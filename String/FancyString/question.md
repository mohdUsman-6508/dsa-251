# `makeFancyString` Function

## Problem Statement

Write a function `makeFancyString` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a modified string where no three consecutive characters are the same. The resulting string should preserve the order of characters, allowing up to two consecutive occurrences of the same character but removing any additional ones.

### Example

```java
makeFancyString("aaabaaaa") // Output: "aabaa"
makeFancyString("aab")      // Output: "aab"
```
