## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`.

### Steps:

1. **Convert** `s` into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet:
   - Replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26.
2. **Transform** the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits.
   - Repeat the transform operation `k` times in total.

### Example

Given `s = "zbax"` and `k = 2`:

1. **Convert**:

   - "z" ➝ 26, "b" ➝ 2, "a" ➝ 1, "x" ➝ 24
   - Concatenate: "zbax" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124

2. **Transform #1**:

   - Sum the digits: 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 17

3. **Transform #2**:
   - Sum the digits of the result from Transform #1: 1 + 7 = 8

### Output

The resulting integer after performing the operations described above is `8`.
