# Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed binary string `s` with an even length.

A string is considered **beautiful** if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

1. Each substring has an even length.
2. Each substring contains only `1`s or only `0`s.

You can change any character in `s` to `0` or `1`.

Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string `s` beautiful.
