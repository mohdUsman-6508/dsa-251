# Problem Statement

On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the location of the `i-th` stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
